### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Soni!

With a background in sales and market research, Iâ€™ve recently taken the exciting leap into the world of web development. I'm currently learning Ruby on Rails and building out my portfolio site â€” [sunflowerly.space](https://sunflowerly.space). Iâ€™ve also been experimenting with Arduino, where Iâ€™ve programmed a fun little LED light display!

I'm looking for a customer support role at a tech startup â€” a space where I can support users with empathy, stay close to the product, and keep leveling up as a developer every day.
